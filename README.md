# Virtual Device Nodeserver

With this nodeserver you can create virtual switches, dimmers or temperature devices to be used in various applications.

The virtual switch and dimmer devices store their data in their variables, both value and init.

The virtual temperature device allows you to extract temperature information from a node into a variable then display that as a device that can be put into a folder for other devices or apps.
